# FEATURE_SPECS (Obsolete)

This file is intentionally kept as a compatibility pointer.

- Canonical planning/discussion/spec lifecycle now lives in `current.md`.
- New feature proposals should be added under `Brainstormed` and promoted to `Specd` in `current.md`.
- Do not add new active specs here.
